# Module 2 Final Project

King County House Sales Analysis 


## Introduction

An exploratory data analysis of the King County Housing database provided by The Flatiron School and found at kaggle.com. My goal in this analysis is to extract meaningful insights from the data and construct them into actionable recommendations using statistical methods, visualizations, and a supervised machine learning algorithm, linear regression. 

## Technologies
* The Jupyter Notebook "student.ipynb" found in this repo contains the data analysis and visualizations used in this project and was created using Python 3.7.6
* There is a powerpoint presentation for non-technical audiences available under the file name "presentation.pdf"

### Necessary libraries to reproduce and run this project are:

* Pandas 
* NumPy
* MatPlotLib
* Seaborn
* SciPy
* DateTime
* Haversine
* SKLearn
* StatsModels

## Objectives

* Explore and analyze dataset using visualizations to identify outliers, distributions, and linear relationships
* Clean data by removing or imputing missing and null values
* Analyze dependent and independent variables for the strongest possible correlation while avoiding high correlations between     independent variables 
* Engineer features to maximize model performance and interpretability
* Model dependent/independent variable relationships using simple and multiple linear regression
* Validate model performance and verify no regression assumptions are violated

## Methodology






#### Visualizations & EDA

* Your project contains at least 4 meaningful data visualizations, with corresponding interpretations. All visualizations are well labeled with axes labels, a title, and a legend (when appropriate)  
* You pose at least 3 meaningful questions and answer them through EDA.  These questions should be well labeled and easy to identify inside the notebook.
    * **Level Up**: Each question is clearly answered with a visualization that makes the answer easy to understand.   
* Your notebook should contain 1 - 2 paragraphs briefly explaining your approach to this project.

#### Model Quality/Approach

* Your model should not include any predictors with p-values greater than .05.  
* Your notebook shows an iterative approach to modeling, and details the parameters and results of the model at each iteration.  
    * **Level Up**: Whenever necessary, you briefly explain the changes made from one iteration to the next, and why you made these choices.  
* You provide at least 1 paragraph explaining your final model.   
* You pick at least 3 coefficients from your final model and explain their impact on the price of a house in this dataset.
